# Shopping-Portal
Welcome to the repository !! This project was developed in C by implementing Files, Data Structures and Algorithms. A software was developed which simulated shopping portals thus enabling users to order items without visiting the store. It has additional features such as viewing current order status, viewing previous orders etc.
